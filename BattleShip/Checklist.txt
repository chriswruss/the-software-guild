Create a start menu / splash screen for the game.
Randomly determine which player goes first.
Create a game workflow object that will contain two boards, keep track of which player's turn it is, and process each player's turn.
A player's turn is as follows:

    Show a grid with marks from the their board's shot history. Place a yellow M in a coordinate if a shot has been fired and missed 
	at that location or a red H if a shot has been fired that has hit.
    Prompt the user for a coordinate entry (ex: B10).
    Validate the entry; if valid, create a coordinate object, convert the letter to a number, and call the opponent board's FireShot() method.
    Retrieve the response from the FireShot method and display an appropriate message to the user.
    Remember to prompt to continue and clear the screen to keep things clean.

When the game ends, prompt the players if they would like to play again. If so, go back to setting up the boards. If not, quit the program.
